Eventuate
=========

Eventuate is a toolkit for building distributed, highly-available and partition-tolerant event-sourced applications. It is written in Scala and built on top of [Akka](http://akka.io), a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM. 
Learn more in the [project documentation](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/) and in the [API docs](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html).
