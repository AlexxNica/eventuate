Eventuate
=========

Eventuate is a toolkit for building distributed, highly-available and partition-tolerant event-sourced applications. It is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and built on top of [Akka](http://akka.io), a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM. Eventuate also provides an implementation of [operation-based CRDTs](https://krasserm.github.io/2015/02/17/Implementing-operation-based-CRDTs/). Learn more in the [project documentation](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/).
